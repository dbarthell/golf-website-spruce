    text: Let get rid of the superscript/subscript under the ZBL AIM when no clock position is selected since we’ll be showing some of that already on the clock and because it takes up space.

        text: Done. Added a new Part 3 to the implementation plan that removes the `.variance-display` block from the non-clock result panel, replacing the `result-value-container` wrapper + variance HTML with a plain `result-value` div. The visual summary table now shows "plain ZBL aim (no variance display)" for the no-clock-selected state. The variance display is kept only in the clock-mode Aim cell (now Part 4), so the result panel and SVG annotations stay consistent — variance is shown geometrically on the clock when a position is selected, and numerically in the result panel only then. Also updated the files changed summary to reflect the new removal step.
